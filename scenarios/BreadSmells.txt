<Eat> 
20 Fresh bread! I took some of the free samples and they were soooo gooood. I'm so happy! +Speed +Exp

50 I took a bite out of the bread but I might have upset a human. Sorry human.

30 I tried to eat the bread but I got shouted at :( Guess I should go. 

<Ask>
25 I asked the human if I could have some bread and they said yes! Thank you, duck fluent human! +Speed +Exp

50 I asked the human about the bread but they couldn't understand me...

25 Scary! I asked about the bread but the human chased me out of their home! Rude! -Distance

<Leave>
30 It'd be rude of me to ask a stranger for bread, so let's get back on the road! +Speed +Exp

40 I left the bread behind, but now it's all I can think about...

20 I'm far from the bread but I can still smell it. I'm haunted by the ghost of fresh bread.
