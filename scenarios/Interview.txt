<Scenario>
It seems like I've got a bit of a reputation! A local newspaper wants to interview me about my journey, do you think I should? I want to inspire other ducks!

Accept
Decline

<Accept> 
45 The interview went well! I got to tell them all about where I hatched, the pond I was raised and why I became a travelling duck. They even drove me in the direction I'm heading! +Distance +Exp

25 I enjoyed the interview, but they had to drive me back to their office for it. Would have liked a lift back to where I was! -Distance

30 I accepted the interview but they only wanted me to talk about ducks with no jobs. I walked out :/ -Motivation -Distance 

<Decline>
50 They were okay with me declining the interview, but the did take a quick photo for their social accounts. I'll get back to them when I'm not on the road! +Speed +Exp

50 After I declined the interview they lectured me on the importance of their newspaper. Whatever, this duck has places to be! #ThinkPositive -Speed
