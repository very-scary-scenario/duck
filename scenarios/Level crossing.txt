<Scenario>
I can hear warning sirens for a level crossing and there's a freight train approaching. Should I catch a lift, like they do in the movies?

Yes
No

<Yes> 
5 The freight train was going slow enough for me to jump onto a carriage with an open side door. I had a nap and made good progress too! +Speed +Distance +Motivation

20 All of the carriages were locked shut, but I managed to perch on a coupler between carriages. It’s not comfortable, but it gets me some extra progress. +Distance

25 Whoops, it was a passenger train, so there was nowhere I can jump on to, and there’s no station nearby.

25 The freight train was going way too fast to get near and before I even got a chance to try and jump on, it was gone. -Speed

25 Attempting to jump onto a passing freight train seemed simple in the movies, but I just bounced off and hit my head. Ouch >_< -Speed -Motivation

<No>
40 As I waited for the train to pass, I realised it’s a passenger train and there was a tiny station nearby! I caught a lift on the train and made some good progress! +Distance

50 I decided not to and watched the freight train go past. It’s far too quick for me to jump onto anyway, so I made the right decision.

10 I decided not to, but the freight train slowed down a lot for the level crossing (I guess it’s a safety thing) so I guess I might have been alright. Never mind… -Motivation
