<Scenario>
Twitter, can I ask you a question? There's a human that's offering me a lift and my feet hurt, should I go for it?

Lift
Decline
Run

<Lift> 
30 I got a lift with the human! It turns out they follow me on Twitter, so thank you for the lift! +Speed +Exp

30 I got in the car with the human but it was an awkward, silent journey. Appreciate it though! +Speed

40 I was in the car with the human but they were salivating a little too much. I flew out of the window to safety. -Distance 

<Decline>
50 I turned down the human but we chatted for a little while. Nice person! +Speed +Exp

20 I told the human I'd rather walk and they seemed rather put out. Sorry, I guess? 

30 When I declined the human's offer they got angry with me. I ran away and hid in a bush :( -Distance

<Run>
15 I ran away while the human was distracted! I'm on a good pace, too! +Speed +Exp

50 I ran from the human but they caught up with me. They seemed a little upset. Sorry, human. -Distance

35 I ran from the human but slipped down a hill. Serves me right for not being honest with them :( -Distance -Speed
