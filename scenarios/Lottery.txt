5 I won some running shoes, for ducks! They weren't very well made so I might have kinda ruined the soles, but I made some good progress. +++Speed +Exp

5 I won some running shoes... for humans. I gave them to a nearby human, who seemed a little bemused about the gift. Ah well!

5 I won a free taxi trip! That'll get me further today, so that's great news! +Distance +Exp

5 I won advice! In exchange for my duck money, the lottery human gave me some "good vibes". Feeling good! +Speed +Exp

5 I won some shopping vouchers! I don't have the ability to grip them though, so I'll be leaving them for someone else. Good luck, I think? +Exp

5 I tried to spin the tombola wheel but I can't reach, on account of me being a duck. The lottery human tried to help but I was so embarrassed :( -Motivation
