<Scenario>
I followed some tooting sounds and found a human playing music out in the open. Do you think it'd be okay for a fine duck like myself to stay and enjoy it?

Tip
Listen
Request

<Tip> 
30 I gave the human some of my hard-earned duck money and they were very happy! That's put a real spring in my step :) +Speed +Exp

35 I gave the human some of my duck money but they complained about the current bad exchange rates. I stayed for the music anyway.

35 When I tried to give the musician some of my duck money, they stopped playing. Is it that weird to see a duck with cash out here? Come on... -Speed 

<Listen>
40 Listening to the music has reinvigorated me! I feel like I can walk for days, and I probably will! +Speed +Exp

35 I listened to the music for a while but it became more and more off key. The musician seemed distracted by me? I was just trying to take a photo...

25 I sat down to listen to the music but the human packed up and left. I don't think they saw me :( -Speed

<Request>
30 The human was happy to play my request! I haven't waddled this much in a long time! +Exp

25 The human was okay with playing a request but they doesn't know much duck music. Ah well.

45 I tried to ask the human to play a request but they couldn't hear me over the music. I quacked my loudest, too. -Speed
