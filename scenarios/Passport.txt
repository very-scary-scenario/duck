<Scenario>
So there's this person asking me for something called a 'passport', but I don't know what one of those is. Like, are they trying to sell me something? What should I do?

Quack
Flap
Escape

<Quack> 
25 I quacked until the person went away! Success! +Exp

40 After quacking for a solid twenty minutes, the human realised I was a duck and let me go. I'm leaving before they come back!

35 I quacked but they asked me for my passport again. I managed to get away by going back the way I came, but that was scary! -Distance -Motivation 

<Flap>
15 My strong flaps kick up some dust, distracting the human enough to allow me to escape. I'm one smart duck! +Speed +Exp

45 While my flapping was ineffective, it did distract the human enough to change the subject. It must be my impressive wingspan.

40 My flapping did indeed get me away from the human, but it seems I'm a little rusty at this flying thing and I shot off in the wrong direction. Oops! #JustDuckProblems -Distance

<Escape>
40 The human underestimated the strength behind these powerful webbed feet and I sped right past them. Later human! +Speed +Exp

35 I tried to escape by running through the human's legs, but I hit my beak on their knee and it might bruise. Got away though. 

25 I panicked when trying to escape and ran in the direction of the human. I guess I have a passport now? -Speed -Motivation
