<Scenario>
Hey Twitter! I’ve just come across a pond - all the way out here! Do you think it’d be okay for me to relax for a bit?

Relax
Drink

<Relax> 
25 Ahh, relaxing was a great idea! I’ve had a chance to stretch my wings and my feet don’t ache any more. I think I can move quicker now! +Speed +Exp

30 Well, I tried to relax but I’m just itching to get going again. Back on the road for me!

45 I tried to relax but the water was cold and there’s a weird guy nearby. I’m outta here. -Speed

<Drink>
40 Ahh, that was some refreshing water. Can’t wait to get back on the road! +Speed +Exp

35 Well, I’ve tasted better. Ah well, good to top up the tank while I can.

25 This water tastes gross. I’d file a complaint but I need to get going… 

<Leave>
15 No time for distractions like thirst! Let's get back on the road. +Speed +Exp

50 I kinda wanted to look at that pond but I guess I should get a move on. Next time!

35 I left the pond behind but I’m so thirsty. Regrets. -Motivation
