40 I took a side road and quickly found a small ramen restaurant. I love ramen! The owner gave me some food and I continued on my way losing very little time. +Speed

40 I walked for a while and, although I didn’t find any restaurants, it turned out to be a shortcut! I saved some time! +Distance

20 Hmmm… there doesn't seem to be anywhere to eat around here, and I think I’m a bit lost too… -Distance -Motivation

15 By imitating a dial-up modem, I used a payphone to order a takeaway. It got here quickly and the driver let me have it for free cos I’m cute (probably). +Speed

55 I managed to make a phone call, but struggled to explain my order using nothing but quacks. Never mind. -Speed

20 I continued on for a bit and I found a food stall on the way! I got a bit of food and I feel refreshed! +Speed

60 Yeah, I should continue on my route for a while. There’ll be a food place later, I’m sure.

20 I’ll just continue on, but I’m really hungry. I should walk at a slower pace to spread out my energy. -Speed
