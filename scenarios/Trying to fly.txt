<Scenario>
According to all known laws of aviation, ducks can fly. I forgot this until just now. Should I fly above the houses or stick to the ground?

High
Low
Walk

<High> 
5 I met a friend! Another duck flying through the area gave me some directions to save some time! +++Distance +Speed

30 The view is lovely up here! I can’t be up here for long, but I made good progress! +Distance

50 I fly for a bit, but there’s nothing like walking to see the sights and the people, so back to it.

15 Oh no! There’s a drone! It’s chasing me back the other way! -Distance

<Low>
15 Children cheer as a pass through the streets. I feel great and I’ve saved a lot of time! +Speed +Distance

35 I manoeuvre through some traffic, but this seems kinda dangerous. I should get back to walking.

50 OUCH! I crashed into a car door. I feel a bit dizzy, time to take things slow for a bit. -Speed

<Walk>
25 You make a good point. I should definitely walk. It’s the best way to see the world! I should get a move on! +Speed

25 I guess I should walk. That’s the name of the game anyway.

25 Yeah, who ever heard of ducks flying. What a daft idea…probably…hmmm… -Speed

25 Oh…there’s a brick wall here…I’m gonna have to turn back. If only I flew… -Distance
