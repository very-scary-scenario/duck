<Scenario>
According to all known laws of aviation, ducks can fly. I forgot this until just now. Should I fly above the houses or stick to the ground?

High
Low
Walk

<High> 
5 I met a friend! Another duck flying through the area gave me some directions to save some time! ++Distance +Motivation

30 The view is lovely up here! I can’t be up here for long, but I made good progress! +Distance

50 I flew for a bit, but there’s nothing like walking to see the sights and the people, so back to it.

15 Oh no! There’s a drone in the sky! It chased me back the other way! -Distance -Motivation

<Low>
15 Children cheered as I flew low through the streets. I feel great and I’ve saved a lot of time! +Distance +Motivation

35 I flew low, manoeuvring through some traffic, but it seemed kinda dangerous. I should get back to walking.

50 OUCH! I crashed into a car door by flying low. I feel a bit dizzy, so I should really take things slow for a bit. -Speed -Motivation

<Walk>
40 Yeah, I should definitely walk. It’s the best way to see the world! I should get a move on. +Speed

30 I guess I should walk. That’s the name of the game anyway.

25 Yeah, who ever heard of ducks flying. What a daft idea. Probably. Hmmm… -Speed -Motivation

5 Oh, there’s a brick wall here. I’m gonna have to turn back. If only I flew… -Distance -Motivation
