<Scenario>
It’s pretty icy out here at the moment and I’m coming up to a twisty country lane. I'm a bit worried about my footing. Should I dash through, take it slow or try and find a different route?

<Dash>
20 I dashed down the country lane, sliding around corners sideways like a sports car. Pretty sure I heard some eurobeak music playing from a house too. I feel awesome! +Speed +Motivation

30 I managed to slip and slide my way along the road without incident, though I don’t think I saved much time by trying to dash.

50 Well, I knew it would happen. I slipped and fell over a bunch of times as I attempted to dash down the road. -Speed -Motivation

<Slow>
40 I gradually made my way down the road without falling over beak-first. I made good time, too! +Speed

50 I slowly made my way along the road and it was *very* slippy. I think I made the right decision to take it slow.

10 Going slowly didn’t make a difference, I still fell on my beak a few times. I’m not a happy duck :( -Motivation

<Different>
25 I decided to go a different way, and I actually found a shortcut! +Distance

40 Going a different way worked out for me! I found a major road that was gritted and safe to walk on that’s basically parallel. +Speed

35 Yeah, this alternate route is going to take a while. At least I won’t fall over a lot, I guess? -Speed
