<Scenario>
Oh gosh. It’s a busy road, and there’s no crossing point either. Twitter, what should I do? I need to get to the other side. Should I search for a place to cross, attempt to cross here or just turn back?

20 I started walking along the road and I found a little tunnel that runs underneath it! I didn’t need to take a detour! +Exp +Speed

60 I walked for a while and found a crossing. Nothing gained, nothing lost, but at least I don’t need to take a big detour.

20 I followed the road for a while and eventually found a crossing point, but it was quite a long detour. -Distance

<Cross>
5 I dived between cars like an action movie hero or an 80’s video game frog! I got across the road quickly and without incident, and I feel great for the journey ahead! +Speed +Motivation

10 I was about to start crossing between cars when I remembered I can fly short distances. I flew over the road while wondering why I didn’t think of this before! +Speed

10 I was about to cross the road when a bus stopped and offered to pick me up! I handed over some duck money and, after the driver checked the exchange rate online, let me on! +Distance

10 Why did the duck cross the road? To get to the other side, obviously. I charged across the road like a duck on a mission. These cars mean nothing to me! I am INVINCIBLE! +Motivation

25 I began to cross the road when a sports car zoomed past faster than the speed limit, immediately followed by police cars. The draught left by the high speed cars blew me back down the path. -Distance -Motivation

40 I crossed the first carriageway of the road without issue, but the other side was busier. I slowly made my way across, dodging cars and trucks. I eventually made it to the other side, but it slowed me down a lot. -Speed

<Turn Back>
20 I turned around to begin heading back and some kids picked me up and threw me over the road. With the wind under my wings, I glided safely to the other side of the road. Not sure if that was the kids’ intention, but success! +Speed

80 Yeah, I should turn back, you’re right. This is too dangerous. I’ll find another way around. -Distance
