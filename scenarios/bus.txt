75 Guess who is on a bus! ðŸšŒ +Speed

10 Well folks, I should have read the timetable. There are no buses coming today. -Motivation -Speed

10 Nobody told me that they don't sell tickets onboard anymore! The bus driver yelled at me :( -Motivation

10 No, let's continue the journey. If I put my mind to it, even I can be faster than a bus! Yeah! +Motivation

70 This duck doesn't need a bus! Let's get back to walking.
